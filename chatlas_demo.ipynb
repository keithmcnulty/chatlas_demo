    "## The `chatlas` package for a consistent LLM interface and workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the frustrations of working with different LLM providers is the difference in API structures.  This has historically meant that developers have had to code up their LLM workflows quite differently if they were working with, say, OpenAI versus Anthropic or Llama.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chatlas` package attempts to overcome this by offering a set of classes and methods that have greater alignment across LLM providers.  This means that starting a chat, or using tool calling or other services will look the same or very similar, no matter which LLM provider you are using.  \n",
